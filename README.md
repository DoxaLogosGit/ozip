# ozip
Simple program for zipping directories using Odin (really just a learning program - nothing fancy)


UPDATE:  
This turned out to be more difficult than I expected. I was assuming that the compression libraries support both reading and writing to zip files.  However, it looks they only support unzipping data into memory only.  I'll have to revisit this if I'm up to writting the actually compression routines for the libraries or not. For now, this served as means to getting past trivial hello world coding of Odin and setting up a debug environment in VS Code on Linux.
