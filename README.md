# ozip
Simple program for zipping directories using Odin (really just a learning program - nothing fancy)

UPDATE: I'll have to revisit this. Writing to a ZIP archive is not supported yet in the Odin library.  I can compress files, but I want to put them in a zip.  This project is meant to go beyond trivial Odin programming as a learning process.
